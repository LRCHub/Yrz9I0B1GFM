When will I, will I be famous?

Yes, you're suitably at one
With your body and the sun
Yes you are
You've read Karl Marx
And you've taught yourself to dance
You're the best by far

But you keep asking the question
One you're not supposed to mention

When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I see my picture in the paper?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
And I can't tell you when
You'll see your name up in lights
When will I, will I be famous?
You keep asking me, babe

You're a slave to fashion
And your life is full of passion
It's the way you are
You've suffered for your art
With the jogging in the park
You know you should go far

But you keep asking the question
One you're not supposed to mention, yeah
(I'm not supposed to mention)

When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I see my picture in the paper?
I can't answer, (I can't wait) I can't answer that
Boy, I can't tell you when
You'll see your name up in lights
When will I, will I be famous?
You keep asking me, babe
(I can't wait)

You won't suffer in silence (silence)
You're a talent, you know that I've noticed (I've noticed)
You'll learn to be a legend (ooh-ooh)
A big star overnight (tell me when)
I can't answer your question (I can't wait)
It's driving me insane (ooh)
And your impossible impatience (impatience)
Tearing at my brain (it's too late)
I can't take it, take it much more
Got too much to hope for

(When will I, will I)
When, when, when, when, wh-wh-wh-wh-when
Will I, will I, will I?
(When will I)
When, when, when, when, wh-wh-wh-wh-when
Will I, will I, will I, will I, will I?

When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that

When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that (what's the point of asking when?)
When will I see my picture in the paper? (In the paper)
I can't answer, I can't answer that (when will I)
(When will I be famous?)
I can't answer, I can't answer that (I can't tell you)

When will I? (Hey, you better believe me)
I can't answer, I can't answer that (tell me when)
When will I, will I be famous? (I can't tell you when)
I can't answer, I can't answer that (I see my name up in lights)
When will I see my picture in the papers?
I can't answer, I can't answer that (I can't tell you)
When will I? (When? When? Tell me when)
I can't answer, I can't answer that (I can't tell you)
When will I, will I be famous?
