분명 나쁜 아이는 아니어도
또 틀에 가두면 we break it
Bum no bigger
than the girl nextdoor
무대 서면 we fake it
No white collar 근데 얜 좀 쳐
When I put mans in their places
모든 시선들은 날 따라와
But we ain't even famous
Don't you try me
I want some more
Don't you play me
we on the floor
Don't you try me
I want some more
(We ain't even famous)
Don't you try me
I want some more
Don't you play me
we on the floor
Don't you try me
I want some more
(We ain't even famous)
Money don't make friends,
only got my fam
Pull up with my M's
and I make the money dance
Funny how it goes
but this is how it ends
This is how I live
by the name Tarzzan
I ain't even famous
다들 날 보면 오 they say less
And my kit in my whip
is the latest
내 가친 조 단위 임마 불러봐
Name is "The Greatest Unfamous"
느껴져 내 분위기
When I walk 다 돌아봐
I be gettin what I need
Those things I've got
Think it's going to my head
Know you lookin' when I dance
Take a quick pic for your friend
내 이름 알아둬
분명 나쁜 아이는 아니어도
또 틀에 가두면 we break it
Bum no bigger
than the girl nextdoor
무대 서면 we fake it
No white collar 근데 얜 좀 쳐
When I put mans in their places
모든 시선들은 날 따라와
But we ain't even famous
I'm stacking my dollars
난 뿌리부터 달라,
초록 빛깔 color
감출 수 없어, 나잖아 빛이
Not even famous
but they wanna be us
같은 공기지만
우린 너무 다른 위치
비교 말어 걔넨 전부 구려
똑같은 걸 해도 I do it better
말해 뭐해 I'm a trendsetter
All day show 'em 끝없는 체력
내 표적은 네 머리
When I walk 다 돌아봐
I be gettin what I need
Those things I've got
Think it's going to my head
Know you lookin' when I dance
Take a quick pic for your friend
내 이름 알아둬
분명 나쁜 아이는 아니어도
또 틀에 가두면 we break it
범 무서운지 모르고 덤벼
겁 없이 I just face it
No white collar 근데 얜 좀 쳐
When I put mans in their places
모든 시선들은 날 따라와
But we ain't even famous
Don't you try me
I want some more
Don't you play me
we on the floor
Don't you try me
I want some more
(We ain't even famous)
Don't you try me
I want some more
Don't you play me
we on the floor
Don't you try me
I want some more
(We ain't even famous)
